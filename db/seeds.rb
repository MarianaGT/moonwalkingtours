# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
tours = Tour.create([
  { name: 'Star Wars', description: "It'll be awesome", price: "$200" },
  { name: 'Lord of the Rings', description: 'It will be awesome', price: '$200' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
