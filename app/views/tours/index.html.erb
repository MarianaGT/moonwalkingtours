      <p>We are a local family that would like to show you around our town in a unique
      way. Fed by several areas of knowledge and different approaches to reality,
      we will journey simultaneously through memory and through some of the most
      relevant issues of our times.</p>
      <p>Our tours are participatory, so not only do we invite you to explore our living
      spaces but your own inner worlds. You don't have to be or know anything in
      particular, just relax and enjoy.</p>
